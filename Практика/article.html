			<h2>Founders of the Future Workshop</h2>
			<img src="img/Founders-of-the-Future-website-photo.JPG" alt="Founders-of-the-Future-website-photo">
			<p>The school recently welcomed Founders of the Future to come in and host a tech sector workshop. </p>
			<p>Founders of the Future aims to empower aspiring entrepreneurs on their journey to set up their own businesses. Students from Putney High, Godolphin & Latymer and Ark Putney Academy joined our pupils for the day, with 80 budding entrepreneurs filling the Wathen Hall.</p>
			<p>The event was a great chance for Paulines to collaborate with students from different schools and backgrounds and produce the outline for a variety of apps which were designed to combat homelessness, excessive waste and inefficient food usage. Those present at the workshop will be submitting their ideas to the F Factor, a nationwide start-up competition that looks to engage students with some of the most pressing problems the world faces, challenging them to come up with innovative solutions to these issues.</p>
			<p>The pupils may be in with the chance to win the competition that is open to 14-18 year olds, with £10k equity up for grabs. Good luck to all the pupils on their first steps towards their entrepreneurial journeys!  </p>
